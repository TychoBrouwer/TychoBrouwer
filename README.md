# Hi Person,

Working on some random projects and some stuff for school. Like to believe I can write good code, working on that since the beginning of 2020.

- Learning languages as I go
    - Working on C++
    - Done some HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, JAVASCRIPT, TYPESCRIPT and PHP
    - Planing some PYTHON or JAVA maybe

## Current
- The [StatsDB overlay](https://www.overwolf.com/app/StatsDB-StatsDB) for Rainbow Six Siege
- A [school project](https://github.com/TychoBrouwer/AquaZoo-Leerdam) involving some Arduino programming
